Even if they are implemented, designers of subclasses will be forced to override the implementation. Like in other cases of \"normal\" inheritance, the abstract method can be invoked with `super()` call mechanism. This makes it possible to provide some basic functionality in the abstract method, which can be enriched by the subclass implementation."
